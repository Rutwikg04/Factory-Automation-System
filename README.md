# Factory Automation System
 
This system will allow Automation of vehicles on a given path as specified in the Factory Floor Plan.

To run the project:
1. Run uploadImage.py to upload map of the location.
2. Run mainServer.py file to start the server.
3. Run controllerServer.py file to start the system and visualize the vehicles on the server node.
4. The client.py file will run on all the client nodes to enable them to move around the factory.

The system currently works for 3 vehicles but can be extended according to the requirements.
